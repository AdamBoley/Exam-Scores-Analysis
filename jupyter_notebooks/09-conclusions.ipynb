    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data analysis notebooks, we validated the project hypotheses as they were investigated. For the sake of completeness, we will validate the hypotheses here as well. Before discussing these, I will briefly discuss the distribution analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After plotting a number of KDE-histograms and conducting the Shapiro-Wilk test, we determined that the dataset's numerical variables are not normally distributed. To correct this, we tried to transform the data using the Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformers. When this failed, we tried removing outlier records. When this failed, we were forced to conclude that the dataset was not normally distributed, and that we could not correct this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 1\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesised that a student's gender affects their test scores. This is true. Male students perform better in maths by 6.5 points, whereas female students perform better in reading by 5 points and in writing by 7.5 points. On average, this means that female students perform better by 2 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 2\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that a student's ethnicity affects their test scores. This is true. Ethnicity E performs the best, closely followed by ethnicity D. Ethnicities B and C perform the worst. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 3\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that a students of better educated parents achieve higher test scores. This is true. Students of better educated parents tend to perform better. This difference is particularly notable in the difference in performance between students of parents who have only some high school education and students of parents who have completed high school, where we see a large increase in performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 4\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that a student's lunch program affects their exam performance. This is true, and considerably so. Students who participate in the standard lunch program score significantly better exam scores than those students who participate in the free/reduced lunch program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 5\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that students who participate in the test preparation course achieve higher exam scores. This is true. Students who complete the test preparation course achieve higher test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 6\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that increased levels of parental education correlate with increased participation in the test preparation course. This is slightly true. Students of better educated parents participate in the test preparation course at slightly higher levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 7\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that increased levels of parental education correlate with increased participation in the standard lunch program. This is slightly true. Students of better educated parents participate in the standard lunch program at a slightly higher rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 8\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that parental education is linked to ethnicity, or more simply that the parents of students of certain ethnicities are better educated. This is true, and not slightly true either. Students of ethnicity groups A and B have parents who are noticably better educated, whereas students of ethnicity groups D and E are noticably less well educated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 9\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that student ethnicity is linked to their lunch program, or more simply that certain ethnicities participate in the different lunch programs at different rates. This is slightly true. Students of ethnicity D participate in the standard lunch program at a higher rate, whereas students of ethnicity E participate in the free/reduced lunch program at a higher rate. The other ethnicity groups have no real difference in lunch program participation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 10\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that student ethnicity is linked to their participation in the test preparation course, or more simply that certain ethnicities participate in the test preparation course at higher rates than others. This is slightly true. Ethnicity group C completes the test preparation course at slightly lower rate, whereas ethnicity group A completes the test preparation course at a slightly higher rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 11\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesized that a student's gender affects their participation in the test preparation course, or more simply that one gender participates in the test preparation course at a higher rate than other. This is false, and we have hypothesized incorrectly. There is no discernable link between a student's gender and their participation in the test preparation course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We have trained 3 machine learning pipelines for predicting a student's math score, reading score and writing score. For the sake of completeness, we will round up the performance of these pipelines in one place, so as to evaluate performance side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "- Recall is the percentage of a particular class that was properly predicted\n",
    "- Precision is the percentage of predicted results related to a particular class that were actually correct\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The math score pipeline required a classification task, after a regression task failed to perform well. We identified the lunch_program, ethnicity and parental_education variables as being the most important, and when the other variables were eliminated, we saw no loss of performance.\n",

    "The key figures here are the recall score on the first class - 68%, and the precision on that same class - 71%. Given that our stated task to identify as many students who will likely underperform as possible, my determination is that recall is the most important score. This determination was aided by [this Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-i-precision-and-recall-9250280bddc2). In particular, the paragraph that begins 'What is more important, precision or recall?' was useful. The author uses the example of a classifier built to detect patients with diabetes. In that case, the classifier needs to be able to correctly identify diabetics, and therefore a high recall score is needed. If we subsitute underperforming students for diabetics, then the same logic applies. This means that 68% (263 out of 388) of students likely to underperform were correctly identified.\n",

That said, the dataset's variables may actually be informative, since the ethnicity variable has 5 possible values, and the parental education variable has 6 possible values.

    "Our models are quite different from one another. The math_score model has the lowest performance, but we predicted that this might be the case when we noted that, in the standard dataset, it has high skew and kurtosis coefficients. That said, the math_score pipeline's performance is not poor, and is acceptable. The math_score model was trained on the lunch_program, ethnicity and parental_education variables.\n",

    "The reading_score pipelines has much better performance, with very high recall scores for the lower class that indicates excellent predictive performance for that class. The reading_score model was trained on the lunch_program and test_preparation_course variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The writing_score pipelines has even better performance, with exceptionally high recall scores for the lower class that indicates near-perfect predictive performance for that class. The writing_score model was trained on the lunch_program, test_preparation_course and parental_education variables."
